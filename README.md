#Getting And Cleaning Data - Course Project

This repository contains the R-code and documentation files for the 
Course Project of "Getting and Cleaning Data" on Coursera.

##Overview
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate our ability to collect,
work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that 
can be used for later analysis.

This project requires submission of:
1) a tidy data set, 
2) a link to a Github repository with the script for performing the 
   analysis, 
3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any 
   transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data 
   called CodeBook.md.
4) a README.md file that explains how all of the scripts work and how 
   they are connected.

The dataset for this project is:
